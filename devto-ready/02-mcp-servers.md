# 🔌 MCP Servers: The Plugin System AI Agents Were Missing

Every AI framework reinvented the same wheel: how to let a model call tools. LangChain had its format, OpenAI had another, Anthropic had yet another.

Then **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** arrived. It's doing for AI agents what USB did for hardware — one standard plug that works everywhere.

## What Is MCP?

An open protocol that standardizes how AI apps connect to tools and data:

```
AI Host (Claude, Copilot) ◄── MCP ──► MCP Server (any tool/API)
```

An MCP server exposes:
- **Tools** — Functions the AI can call
- **Resources** — Data the AI can read
- **Prompts** — Reusable prompt templates

## Before vs After MCP

**Before:** Three different formats for the same capability. Maintain three integrations.

**After:**

```python
from mcp.server import Server

server = Server("my-search-server")

@server.tool("search")
async def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the database."""
    return await db.search(query)

# Works with Claude, Copilot, Cursor, and everything else.
```

Write once, run everywhere. That's the promise, and it delivers.

## Build One in 5 Minutes

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({ name: "project-docs", version: "1.0.0" });

server.tool(
  "search_docs",
  "Search project docs by keyword",
  { query: z.string() },
  async ({ query }) => {
    // Your search logic here
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: results }] };
  }
);
```

Register it, and any MCP-compatible AI can now search your docs natively.

## The Ecosystem (2026)

| Category | MCP Servers |
|----------|------------|
| Databases | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis |
| Cloud | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| DevOps | GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins |
| Monitoring | Datadog, Grafana, PagerDuty |

## Security First

1. **Least privilege** — Only expose what's needed
2. **Read-only by default** — Opt-in for writes
3. **Validate inputs** — Use Zod schemas
4. **Log everything** — Audit every tool invocation

## Bottom Line

If you maintain internal tools or APIs, wrapping them in an MCP server is the highest-leverage thing you can do right now. One server. One tool. Watch how it transforms your workflow.
