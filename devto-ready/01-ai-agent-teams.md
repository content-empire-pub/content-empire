# 🤖 Building AI Agent Teams That Actually Ship Code

The idea of a single AI assistant is already old news. The real frontier? **Teams of AI agents** that collaborate, review each other's work, and ship production code.

After six months of building multi-agent workflows, here's what works and what's hype.

## Why Single Agents Hit a Ceiling

Copilot, Cursor, Claude — great for autocomplete and boilerplate. But ask one agent to build a complete feature across multiple files with tests? It struggles. The bottleneck: **context window management** and **task decomposition**.

## The Architecture That Works

We use a three-agent team that mirrors real engineering orgs:

```
Architect → Implementer → Reviewer
        ↑       ↓            ↓
        └── Shared Context Store ──┘
```

**Architect:** Reads the codebase, produces a plan. Never writes code.
**Implementer:** Codes one file at a time following the plan.
**Reviewer:** Catches bugs before any human sees the code.

## The Secret: Shared Context

The biggest mistake? Treating agents as isolated workers. Without shared context, Agent B has no idea what Agent A decided.

```python
class AgentContext:
    decisions = []      # Why choices were made
    constraints = []    # What must not change
    file_index = {}     # What each file does
    test_results = []   # Latest test outcomes
```

Every agent gets this context at every step. It's the institutional memory.

## Real Results

Our agent team has:
- Built a complete REST API (12 endpoints) in **45 minutes**
- Migrated Express to Fastify with **zero test regression**
- Created a React component library with **20+ components**
- Fixed **34 bugs** in a single afternoon

## What Doesn't Work Yet

Let's be honest:
- Complex architectural choices → still need humans
- Performance optimization → agents write correct but not fast code
- Cross-service debugging → agents lose the thread
- UI/UX decisions → agents can't judge "good"

## Get Started

```yaml
agents:
  implementer:
    model: claude-sonnet-4
    role: "Write code following the plan"
  reviewer:
    model: claude-sonnet-4
    role: "Review for bugs and correctness"
workflow:
  - implementer: execute_plan
  - reviewer: review_changes
  - if_rejected: goto implementer
```

Start small with just implementer + reviewer. You'll never go back.
