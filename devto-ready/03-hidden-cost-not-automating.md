# 💸 The Hidden Cost of Not Automating Your Dev Workflow

You know you *should* automate more. You still manually run tests, hand-deploy to staging, and type the same git commands dozens of times daily.

The cost doesn't show up in Jira. But it's there — silently eating your week.

## The Numbers

We tracked 8 developers for two weeks:

| Manual Task | Weekly Total |
|---|---|
| Running tests before PR | 4.8 hours |
| Setting up local env | 50 min |
| Manual deployments | 45 min |
| Checking CI in browser | 1.7 hours |
| Copy-pasting configs | 25 min |

**Total: ~8.5 hours/week** per developer on automatable tasks. A full working day, gone.

## It's Worse Than You Think

### Context Switching
Every alt-tab to check CI breaks flow state. Microsoft research: **23 minutes** to regain deep focus. At 15 switches/day, you're losing way more than task time.

### Human Error
- 12% of manual deploys had config mistakes
- 23% of env setups needed retries

### Knowledge Silos
Deployment process in someone's head = single point of failure. Hope they don't go on vacation.

## Quick Wins (Do These Today)

### 1. Git Hooks

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
npx prettier --write --staged
npx eslint --fix --staged
```

### 2. One-Command Setup

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
npm ci
docker compose up -d postgres redis
npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed
echo "✅ Ready!"
```

### 3. Auto Changelog

```json
{ "scripts": { "release": "standard-version" } }
```

Conventional commits → changelog writes itself.

## The ROI

8.5 hours × 8 devs × $75/hour = **$5,100/week wasted**. That's **$265K/year**.

Add reduced bugs, faster onboarding → **$375K/year** in value. Investment? 2-4 weeks of one dev's time.

## Start Now

Pick your most annoying manual task. Automate it. Pick the next one. Repeat. Within a month, you'll wonder how you ever worked without it.
